Scheduler logic:

	In Ride class:
		store driving times - the physical time that will be spent driving
		A key-value pair data structure where key is the user and value is an array of possible driving times for that user
		

	Calculate number x - number of driving times / number of users	
		Each user will drive that many times

	Randomize each users list option available if you want different schedules each period week/month etc
	
	Backtracking
		Sort users by number of available times to drive (smallest to largest)
		Assign first person first x availale driving times
		Continue to next person
			ignore times that have already been assigned
			Assign x times
			Return true

			Return false if adding driver becomes impossible
				return to the last person and aassign different times



bool WriteSchedule() {
	
	if there is no unassigned time
		return true, schedule is done
	else
		for each possible driving time of the current user
			make a tentative assignment that works
			move to next user

			if (WriteSchedule(schedule with assignment))
				return true
			else
				Undo assignment
		backtrack (i.e. return false) (move back one user)

}
