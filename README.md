Carpool app for iOS and Android

We hope to create an intuitive carpool and ride organiser.  People will be able to create or join public carpools, or choose invite only.  The application will construct a ride schedule and send it to all those involved, telling them who is driving which days.  For single use rides, a person can create an event and add people to pick up, who can RSVP directly in the app.
Before the driver leaves to pick people up, he/she presses the "on my way" button, which alerts riders.  Conversly, when riders are ready to be picked up, they can send a "ready" alert.
Using GPS and Google maps integration, the driver will be able to broadcast his position in real time, so riders can track their location.  Likewise, the driver will recieve locations of where to pick up the riders.
